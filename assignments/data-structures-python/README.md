# 📘 Assignment: Data Structures in Python

## 🎯 Objective

Learn and practice using Python's built-in data structures: lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples. Complete tasks that demonstrate how to create, modify, and use these data structures in real-world scenarios.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ List Operations

#### Description
Work with Python lists to store, access, and modify collections of data. Practice common operations such as adding, removing, and sorting elements.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create a list of at least 5 items
- Add and remove elements from the list
- Sort the list and print the result

### 🛠️ Dictionary Usage

#### Description
Use Python dictionaries to store key-value pairs. Practice accessing, updating, and iterating over dictionary items.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs
- Update a value for an existing key
- Iterate over the dictionary and print each key and value

### 🛠️ Set Operations

#### Description
Explore Python sets to store unique items and perform set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create two sets with some overlapping values
- Find and print the union, intersection, and difference of the sets

### 🛠️ Tuple Usage

#### Description
Work with Python tuples to store immutable sequences of data. Practice accessing elements and unpacking tuples.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create a tuple with at least 4 elements
- Access and print the second and last elements
- Unpack the tuple into separate variables and print them
